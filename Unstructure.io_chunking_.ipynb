The exchange rate used is set by Wells Fargo, includes a markup and may be different than exchange rates you see elsewhere. Incoming wire transfers received in a foreign currency for payment into your account will be converted into U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate without prior notice to you. For more information, see the \\u201cApplicable exchange rate\\u201d and \\u201cIncoming international wire transfers\\u201d sections of the Deposit Account Agreement. ** The Relationship Interest Rate is variable and subject to change at any time without notice, including setting the interest rate equal to the Standard Interest Rate or to zero (0.00%), which could change the Relationship Annual Percentage Yield (APY). For time accounts, the change will occur upon renewal. To receive the disclosed Relationship Interest Rate/Relationship APY, the eligible account must remain linked to a Prime Checking or Premier Checking account. Time accounts must be linked at account open and at every renewal. If the checking account is closed for any reason or the eligible savings account or time account is de-linked, the account will revert to the then-current applicable Standard Interest Rate on that date; for time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. Any Special Interest Rate would not expire until the expiration date of that Special Interest Rate.\",\n",

The benefit applies to the exchange rate for foreign currency purchases, when you purchase foreign currency through the Wells Fargo Foreign Currency call center, online at wellsfargo.com, or through a Wells Fargo branch. You\\u2019ll also receive the benefit when you purchase or sell foreign currency at a Wells Fargo branch. In addition to any applicable fees, we make money when we convert one currency to another currency for you. The exchange rate used when we convert one currency to another is set at our sole discretion, and it includes a markup. The markup is designed to compensate us for several considerations including, without limitation, costs incurred, market risks, and our desired return. The applicable exchange rate does not include, and is separate from, any applicable fees listed in this Consumer Schedule. The exchange rate we provide to you may be different from exchange rates you see elsewhere. Different customers may receive different rates for transactions that are the same or similar, and the applicable exchange rate may be different for foreign currency cash, drafts, checks, or wire transfers. Foreign exchange markets are dynamic, and rates fluctuate over time based on market conditions, liquidity, and risks. We\\u2019re your arms-length counterparty on foreign exchange transactions.

If the cashier\\u2019s check is lost, stolen, or destroyed , you may request a stop payment and reissuance. A stop payment and reissuance can only be completed within a branch location. As a condition of stop payment and reissuance, Wells Fargo Bank will require an indemnity agreement. In addition, for cashier\\u2019s checks over $1,000.00, the waiting period before the stop payment and reissuance of an outstanding cashier's check may be processed is 90 days (30 days in the state of Wisconsin and 91 days in the state of New York). The waiting period can be avoided with the purchase of an acceptable surety bond. This can be purchased through Wells Fargo\\u2019s approved insurance carrier or through an insurance carrier of the customer\\u2019s choice. The cost of a surety bond varies depending on the amount of the bond and the insurer used. Surety bonds are subject to the insurance carrier\\u2019s underwriting requirements before issuance. If the surety bond is not provided, the waiting period applies. 6. Fees may be charged by third parties or other banks, in addition to those described above. 7.

      "NarrativeText: This document helps you understand your account features and requirements, the fees that may apply, and how to minimize or avoid fees where possible. If you don’t find your account type listed, check with a Wells Fargo banker for information about your account, including fees and other important information.\n",
      "NarrativeText: What we mean by fee period and why it matters\n",
      "NarrativeText: How we track and report your account activity, including what’s provided in your account statements, doesn’t always match a calendar month. Instead, we use a fee period to determine the monthly service fee and other monthly fees. A fee period can have 25 to 35 days. We calculate and post your monthly service fee, if any, on the last business day of your fee period. If your account allows you to avoid a monthly service fee, knowing your fee period end date will help you keep track of when you need to meet one of the options available to avoid the fee.\n",
      "NarrativeText: You’ll find the dates of your fee period in the Monthly service fee summary on your account statement. The fee period end date is the last day posted transactions and account changes apply to that fee period. If your fee period ends on the last calendar day of the month, only transactions posted through the last business day of the month will count towards the fee period. Pending transactions displayed in online banking are not posted transactions. Deposits we make available early with Early Pay Day are pending transactions until the deposit posts on the pay date scheduled by your payor.\n",
      "NarrativeText: See “Determining the day your deposit is received by the Bank” in the “Availability of Funds Policy” section in the Deposit Account Agreement for more details on transaction posting. Unless otherwise specified, maintenance or service requests for your account (for instance, setting up an automatic transfer or linking accounts) made after the cutoff time or on a non-business day will be processed and made effective on the next business day. Combined balances are determined one business day prior to the last business day of your fee period.\n",
      "NarrativeText: Prime Checking and Premier Checking accounts only: The fee period ends on the last business day of the calendar month. We use your statement-ending qualifying balance to determine your eligibility to avoid the monthly service fee. We calculate the monthly service fee, if any, on the last business day of the calendar month and post the fee on or about the first business day of the following month. Monthly service fee summary is not available on the statement.\n",
      "NarrativeText: Initial monthly service fee waiver: We’ll waive the monthly service fee for each fee period ending within the first 64 days of opening.\n",
      "NarrativeText: Other fees subject to the fee period: We also use the fee period to count the number of posted transactions we allow before charging a fee. For example, if your account allows a certain number of no-charge ATM transactions each fee period, we’ll only charge for ATM transactions after that number has been met within the fee period. Another example of such a fee is the check image option fee.\n",
      "NarrativeText: Your fee period can change: We may, at our discretion, change your fee period without prior notification. For example, when accounts are brought together into a combined statement, we change the fee period to match the fee period of the first account listed on the statement. When accounts are delinked from a combined statement, we may change the fee period for the delinked accounts.\n",
      "NarrativeText: Effect of Early Pay Day: Direct deposits made available early with Early Pay Day will not count towards applicable options to avoid your account's monthly service fee until the deposit posts to your account and is no longer pending (e.g., the pay date scheduled by your payor). For more information about Early Pay Day, please refer to our Deposit Account Agreement.\n",
      "NarrativeText: Minimum daily balance Minimum daily balance refers to the lowest ending daily balance recorded during the fee period after all\n",
      "NarrativeText: transactions have gone through nightly processing.\n",
      "NarrativeText: Primary account owner When there is more than one owner of an account, we identify a primary owner. The primary account\n",
      "NarrativeText: owner is the owner whose Taxpayer Identification Number, such as a Social Security Number, is assigned to the account and who, therefore, has tax responsibility for the account. For select checking and savings accounts, when an individual primary account owner reaches the age of 25, age can no longer be used to avoid the monthly service fee. Depending on the type of account you have, there may be other ways to avoid the monthly service fee. If the primary owner of an existing Everyday Checking, Clear Access BankingSM, or Way2Save® Savings account changes, it may take up to 45 days after the change is made to avoid the monthly service fee based on age.\n",
      "Title: Interest-bearing accounts\n",
      "NarrativeText: For interest-bearing accounts, you may earn interest based on the account’s daily collected balance. The interest rate may be as low as 0.00%, and variable interest rates may be changed by the Bank at any time. Interest is compounded daily and paid monthly using a 365-day year. For more payment options for CDs, see “Interest on your CD” in the “Time Accounts (CDs)” section of the Deposit Account Agreement. For Prime Checking and Premier Checking, your Relationship Interest Rate will end if you or the Bank close your Prime Checking or Premier Checking account or de-link an eligible time account (CD) or savings account; for CDs this change occurs at renewal. For more information, review “Interest-bearing accounts” in the “Statements, Interest, and Other Account Information” section of the Deposit Account Agreement.\n",

      "ListItem: 4. Outstanding Cashier’s checks and Money Orders are subject to state or territorial unclaimed property laws. 5. If the cashier’s check is lost, stolen, or destroyed , you may request a stop payment and reissuance. A stop payment and reissuance can only be completed within a branch location. As a condition of stop payment and reissuance, Wells Fargo Bank will require an indemnity agreement. In addition, for cashier’s checks over $1,000.00, the waiting period before the stop payment and reissuance of an outstanding cashier's check may be processed is 90 days (30 days in the state of Wisconsin and 91 days in the state of New York). The waiting period can be avoided with the purchase of an acceptable surety bond. This can be purchased through Wells Fargo’s approved insurance carrier or through an insurance carrier of the customer’s choice. The cost of a surety bond varies depending on the amount of the bond and the insurer used. Surety bonds are subject to the insurance carrier’s underwriting requirements before issuance. If the surety bond is not provided, the waiting period applies. 6. Fees may be charged by third parties or other banks, in addition to those described above. 7.

The exchange rate used is set by Wells Fargo, includes a markup and may be different than exchange rates you see elsewhere. Incoming wire transfers received in a foreign currency for payment into your account will be converted into U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate without prior notice to you. For more information, see the “Applicable exchange rate” and “Incoming international wire transfers” sections of the Deposit Account Agreement. ** The Relationship Interest Rate is variable and subject to change at any time without notice, including setting the interest rate equal to the Standard Interest Rate or to zero (0.00%), which could change the Relationship Annual Percentage Yield (APY). For time accounts, the change will occur upon renewal. To receive the disclosed Relationship Interest Rate/Relationship APY, the eligible account must remain linked to a Prime Checking or Premier Checking account. Time accounts must be linked at account open and at every renewal. If the checking account is closed for any reason or the eligible savings account or time account is de-linked, the account will revert to the then-current applicable Standard Interest Rate on that date; for time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal.

In addition to any applicable fees, we make money when we convert one currency to another currency for you. The exchange rate used when we convert one currency to another is set at our sole discretion, and it includes a markup. The markup is designed to compensate us for several considerations including, without limitation, costs incurred, market risks, and our desired return. The applicable exchange rate does not include, and is separate from, any applicable fees listed in this Consumer Schedule. The exchange rate we provide to you may be different from exchange rates you see elsewhere. Different customers may receive different rates for transactions that are the same or similar, and the applicable exchange rate may be different for foreign currency cash, drafts, checks, or wire transfers. Foreign exchange markets are dynamic, and rates fluctuate over time based on market conditions, liquidity, and risks. We’re your arms-length counterparty on foreign exchange transactions. We may refuse to process any request for a foreign exchange transaction.\n",

If the cashier’s check is lost, stolen, or destroyed , you may request a stop payment and reissuance. A stop payment and reissuance can only be completed within a branch location. As a condition of stop payment and reissuance, Wells Fargo Bank will require an indemnity agreement. In addition, for cashier’s checks over $1,000.00, the waiting period before the stop payment and reissuance of an outstanding cashier's check may be processed is 90 days (30 days in the state of Wisconsin and 91 days in the state of New York). The waiting period can be avoided with the purchase of an acceptable surety bond. This can be purchased through Wells Fargo’s approved insurance carrier or through an insurance carrier of the customer’s choice. The cost of a surety bond varies depending on the amount of the bond and the insurer used. Surety bonds are subject to the insurance carrier’s underwriting requirements before issuance. If the surety bond is not provided, the waiting period applies. 6. Fees may be charged by third parties or other banks, in addition to those described above. 7.

      "Be sure to review the Deposit Account Agreement, including the “Glossary” section, for important defined terms used in this Schedule. We regularly update this Consumer Schedule. You can get a copy of the current Consumer Schedule at wellsfargo.com , by requesting it from a banker, or by phone.\n",

      "Overview & Key Terms\n",
      "This document helps you understand your account features and requirements, the fees that may apply, and how to minimize or avoid fees where possible. If you don’t find your account type listed, check with a Wells Fargo banker for information about your account, including fees and other important information.\n",
      "What we mean by fee period and why it matters\n",
      "How we track and report your account activity, including what’s provided in your account statements, doesn’t always match a calendar month. Instead, we use a fee period to determine the monthly service fee and other monthly fees. A fee period can have 25 to 35 days. We calculate and post your monthly service fee, if any, on the last business day of your fee period. If your account allows you to avoid a monthly service fee, knowing your fee period end date will help you keep track of when you need to meet one of the options available to avoid the fee.\n",
      "You’ll find the dates of your fee period in the Monthly service fee summary on your account statement. The fee period end date is the last day posted transactions and account changes apply to that fee period. If your fee period ends on the last calendar day of the month, only transactions posted through the last business day of the month will count towards the fee period. Pending transactions displayed in online banking are not posted transactions. Deposits we make available early with Early Pay Day are pending transactions until the deposit posts on the pay date scheduled by your payor.\n",
      "See “Determining the day your deposit is received by the Bank” in the “Availability of Funds Policy” section in the Deposit Account Agreement for more details on transaction posting. Unless otherwise specified, maintenance or service requests for your account (for instance, setting up an automatic transfer or linking accounts) made after the cutoff time or on a non-business day will be processed and made effective on the next business day. Combined balances are determined one business day prior to the last business day of your fee period.\n",
      "Prime Checking and Premier Checking accounts only: The fee period ends on the last business day of the calendar month. We use your statement-ending qualifying balance to determine your eligibility to avoid the monthly service fee. We calculate the monthly service fee, if any, on the last business day of the calendar month and post the fee on or about the first business day of the following month. Monthly service fee summary is not available on the statement.\n",
      "Initial monthly service fee waiver: We’ll waive the monthly service fee for each fee period ending within the first 64 days of opening.\n",
      "Other fees subject to the fee period: We also use the fee period to count the number of posted transactions we allow before charging a fee. For example, if your account allows a certain number of no-charge ATM transactions each fee period, we’ll only charge for ATM transactions after that number has been met within the fee period. Another example of such a fee is the check image option fee.\n",
      "Your fee period can change: We may, at our discretion, change your fee period without prior notification. For example, when accounts are brought together into a combined statement, we change the fee period to match the fee period of the first account listed on the statement. When accounts are delinked from a combined statement, we may change the fee period for the delinked accounts.\n",
      "Effect of Early Pay Day: Direct deposits made available early with Early Pay Day will not count towards applicable options to avoid your account's monthly service fee until the deposit posts to your account and is no longer pending (e.g., the pay date scheduled by your payor). For more information about Early Pay Day, please refer to our Deposit Account Agreement.\n",
      "Minimum daily balance Minimum daily balance refers to the lowest ending daily balance recorded during the fee period after all\n",
      "transactions have gone through nightly processing.\n",
      "Primary account owner When there is more than one owner of an account, we identify a primary owner. The primary account\n",
      "owner is the owner whose Taxpayer Identification Number, such as a Social Security Number, is assigned to the account and who, therefore, has tax responsibility for the account. For select checking and savings accounts, when an individual primary account owner reaches the age of 25, age can no longer be used to avoid the monthly service fee. Depending on the type of account you have, there may be other ways to avoid the monthly service fee. If the primary owner of an existing Everyday Checking, Clear Access BankingSM, or Way2Save® Savings account changes, it may take up to 45 days after the change is made to avoid the monthly service fee based on age.\n",
      "Interest-bearing accounts\n",
      "For interest-bearing accounts, you may earn interest based on the account’s daily collected balance. The interest rate may be as low as 0.00%, and variable interest rates may be changed by the Bank at any time. Interest is compounded daily and paid monthly using a 365-day year. For more payment options for CDs, see “Interest on your CD” in the “Time Accounts (CDs)” section of the Deposit Account Agreement. For Prime Checking and Premier Checking, your Relationship Interest Rate will end if you or the Bank close your Prime Checking or Premier Checking account or de-link an eligible time account (CD) or savings account; for CDs this change occurs at renewal. For more information, review “Interest-bearing accounts” in the “Statements, Interest, and Other Account Information” section of the Deposit Account Agreement.\n",

The exchange rate used is set by Wells Fargo, includes a markup and may be different than exchange rates you see elsewhere. Incoming wire transfers received in a foreign currency for payment into your account will be converted into U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate without prior notice to you. For more information, see the “Applicable exchange rate” and “Incoming international wire transfers” sections of the Deposit Account Agreement.\n",
      "Campus Card fee benefits will take effect within 45 days following the linkage of your Campus Card to an Everyday Checking or Clear Access Banking account and will end 60 days after your Campus Card is no longer linked to the account. The Bank’s standard Everyday Checking or Clear Access Banking account terms and fees will apply when the Campus Card is no longer linked. For more information, review this Consumer Schedule and the \"Additional information for Wells Fargo Campus Card Program customers” section of the Deposit Account Agreement.\n",
      "Clear Access Banking\n",
      "Clear Access Banking is a checkless banking account. You cannot write checks against the account (including starter checks, temporary checks and personal checks ordered from a third party). Any checks written on this account will be returned unpaid, even if there’s enough money in the account to cover the payment. When a payee or merchant uses your account number and routing number to process a payment as a check, that transaction will be declined. It’s important that you notify the payee or merchant to make sure they don’t process your payment as a check. Otherwise, the payee or merchant may charge you a fee for a returned check. References in the Deposit Account Agreement to check-writing capabilities don’t apply to Clear Access Banking accounts.\n",

      "No overdraft coverage Our standard overdraft coverage does not apply to Clear Access Banking accounts. You cannot request that standard overdraft coverage be added to your account. With Clear Access Banking, if you don’t have available funds in your account to cover the transaction when it is presented to us for authorization or payment, we will: • Return certain transactions presented to us for payment (such as ACH payments) unpaid. • Not authorize ATM and everyday (one-time) debit card transactions into overdraft. • Not authorize other transactions (such as recurring debit card transactions or Bill Pay transactions)\n",
      "into overdraft.\n",
      "We won’t charge you a fee if we return or decline to authorize an item. However, payees or merchants may still charge a fee. Other optional overdraft services, such as Overdraft Protection and Debit Card Overdraft Service, are also unavailable on this account. References in the Deposit Account Agreement and in this document to standard overdraft coverage, Overdraft Protection, and Debit Card Overdraft Service, including associated overdraft fees, don’t apply to Clear Access Banking accounts.\n",
      "Negative balance Although we won’t authorize transactions—such as ATM withdrawals, debit card purchases, or recurring debit card transactions—when you don’t have enough money in your account to cover them when they are presented to us for authorization, certain transactions or account activity may result in a negative balance. For example, if you add a tip to a transaction after we’ve approved the transaction without the tip OR if we credit a deposit that is later returned unpaid, you may see a negative balance in your account. We won’t charge an overdraft fee for these transactions. You simply need to repay the negative amount promptly.\n",
      "Converting to Clear Access Banking from an account that has checks If you switch from a Wells Fargo account with check writing ability to a Clear Access Banking account, any outstanding check(s) presented on the new Clear Access Banking account on or after the date of conversion will be returned unpaid. The payee may charge additional fees when the check is returned. Make sure that any outstanding checks have been paid and/or you have made different arrangements with the payee(s) for the checks you have written before converting to the Clear Access Banking account.\n",
      "Converting to Clear Access Banking from an account that has overdraft services If you switch from a Wells Fargo account that included our standard overdraft coverage or was enrolled in our optional Debit Card Overdraft Service, those services will be removed from your account at the time of conversion. If your prior account was enrolled in our optional Overdraft Protection service, it will be removed from your account on the second business day after conversion (e.g., if you convert on Monday, it will be removed on Wednesday) and transactions occurring before removal may be paid into overdraft or returned unpaid, subject to the following exception: removal of Overdraft Protection from a linked savings account will be delayed by one business day for each day an Overdraft Protection transfer occurs after conversion.\n",
      "Any fees (for example, overdraft fees) resulting from account activity made or authorized prior to conversion may post to the account after conversion. In this event, any such fees will also be reflected in account activity summaries located within online banking and your account statement.\n",
      "Additional account limitations If you don’t qualify for our standard deposit accounts due to past credit or banking history and received the Funds Availability Adverse Action Notice as a part of your new account application process, you can still open or convert into a Clear Access Banking account. This will allow you to take advantage of Clear Access Banking features and benefits. For the first 365 days from the date your new account is opened (or from the date the account you’re converting from was opened, whichever is less), you won’t be able to convert into any other Wells Fargo account. After 365 days, you can convert into any Wells Fargo consumer checking account offered at that time.\n",
      "With the Worldwide Military Banking program, all non-Wells Fargo ATM cash withdrawal transaction fees will be waived worldwide for eligible checking accounts with a qualifying military direct deposit. Fees may still be charged by the non-Wells Fargo ATM operator or network. Prime Checking and Premier Checking accounts are not eligible for this program as they already receive a non-Wells Fargo ATM cash withdrawal fee waiver.\n",
      "To be eligible for the program, you must receive a qualifying military direct deposit of your salary, pension, or disability benefits electronically deposited from Department of Defense/Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DOD/DFAS), Department of Veterans Affairs/Veterans Benefits Administration (VA/ VBA), or U.S. Department of the Treasury from any branch of the United States military into an eligible checking account. An account will receive program benefits 45 days after the qualifying military direct deposit is deposited into the checking account. Your checking account will no longer receive benefits under this program if a qualifying military direct deposit is no longer deposited monthly into your qualifying checking account.\n",

      "overview & key terms\n",
      "this document helps you understand your account features and requirements, the fees that may apply, and how to minimize or avoid fees where possible. if you don’t find your account type listed, check with a wells fargo banker for information about your account, including fees and other important information.\n",
      "what we mean by fee period and why it matters\n",
      "how we track and report your account activity, including what’s provided in your account statements, doesn’t always match a calendar month. instead, we use a fee period to determine the monthly service fee and other monthly fees. a fee period can have 25 to 35 days. we calculate and post your monthly service fee, if any, on the last business day of your fee period. if your account allows you to avoid a monthly service fee, knowing your fee period end date will help you keep track of when you need to meet one of the options available to avoid the fee.\n",
      "you’ll find the dates of your fee period in the monthly service fee summary on your account statement. the fee period end date is the last day posted transactions and account changes apply to that fee period. if your fee period ends on the last calendar day of the month, only transactions posted through the last business day of the month will count towards the fee period. pending transactions displayed in online banking are not posted transactions. deposits we make available early with early pay day are pending transactions until the deposit posts on the pay date scheduled by your payor.\n",
      "see “determining the day your deposit is received by the bank” in the “availability of funds policy” section in the deposit account agreement for more details on transaction posting. unless otherwise specified, maintenance or service requests for your account (for instance, setting up an automatic transfer or linking accounts) made after the cutoff time or on a non-business day will be processed and made effective on the next business day. combined balances are determined one business day prior to the last business day of your fee period.\n",
      "prime checking and premier checking accounts only: the fee period ends on the last business day of the calendar month. we use your statement-ending qualifying balance to determine your eligibility to avoid the monthly service fee. we calculate the monthly service fee, if any, on the last business day of the calendar month and post the fee on or about the first business day of the following month. monthly service fee summary is not available on the statement.\n",
      "initial monthly service fee waiver: we’ll waive the monthly service fee for each fee period ending within the first 64 days of opening.\n",
      "other fees subject to the fee period: we also use the fee period to count the number of posted transactions we allow before charging a fee. for example, if your account allows a certain number of no-charge atm transactions each fee period, we’ll only charge for atm transactions after that number has been met within the fee period. another example of such a fee is the check image option fee.\n",
      "your fee period can change: we may, at our discretion, change your fee period without prior notification. for example, when accounts are brought together into a combined statement, we change the fee period to match the fee period of the first account listed on the statement. when accounts are delinked from a combined statement, we may change the fee period for the delinked accounts.\n",
      "effect of early pay day: direct deposits made available early with early pay day will not count towards applicable options to avoid your account's monthly service fee until the deposit posts to your account and is no longer pending (e.g., the pay date scheduled by your payor). for more information about early pay day, please refer to our deposit account agreement.\n",
      "minimum daily balance minimum daily balance refers to the lowest ending daily balance recorded during the fee period after all\n",
      "transactions have gone through nightly processing.\n",
      "primary account owner when there is more than one owner of an account, we identify a primary owner. the primary account\n",
      "owner is the owner whose taxpayer identification number, such as a social security number, is assigned to the account and who, therefore, has tax responsibility for the account. for select checking and savings accounts, when an individual primary account owner reaches the age of 25, age can no longer be used to avoid the monthly service fee. depending on the type of account you have, there may be other ways to avoid the monthly service fee. if the primary owner of an existing everyday checking, clear access bankingsm, or way2save® savings account changes, it may take up to 45 days after the change is made to avoid the monthly service fee based on age.\n",
      "interest-bearing accounts\n",
      "for interest-bearing accounts, you may earn interest based on the account’s daily collected balance. the interest rate may be as low as 0.00%, and variable interest rates may be changed by the bank at any time. interest is compounded daily and paid monthly using a 365-day year. for more payment options for cds, see “interest on your cd” in the “time accounts (cds)” section of the deposit account agreement. for prime checking and premier checking, your relationship interest rate will end if you or the bank close your prime checking or premier checking account or de-link an eligible time account (cd) or savings account; for cds this change occurs at renewal. for more information, review “interest-bearing accounts” in the “statements, interest, and other account information” section of the deposit account agreement.\n",

      "converting to clear access banking from an account that has checks if you switch from a wells fargo account with check writing ability to a clear access banking account, any outstanding check(s) presented on the new clear access banking account on or after the date of conversion will be returned unpaid. the payee may charge additional fees when the check is returned. make sure that any outstanding checks have been paid and/or you have made different arrangements with the payee(s) for the checks you have written before converting to the clear access banking account.\n",
      "converting to clear access banking from an account that has overdraft services if you switch from a wells fargo account that included our standard overdraft coverage or was enrolled in our optional debit card overdraft service, those services will be removed from your account at the time of conversion. if your prior account was enrolled in our optional overdraft protection service, it will be removed from your account on the second business day after conversion (e.g., if you convert on monday, it will be removed on wednesday) and transactions occurring before removal may be paid into overdraft or returned unpaid, subject to the following exception: removal of overdraft protection from a linked savings account will be delayed by one business day for each day an overdraft protection transfer occurs after conversion.\n",

      "what we mean by fee period and why it matters\n",
      "how we track and report your account activity, including what’s provided in your account statements, doesn’t always match a calendar month. instead, we use a fee period to determine the monthly service fee and other monthly fees. a fee period can have 25 to 35 days. we calculate and post your monthly service fee, if any, on the last business day of your fee period. if your account allows you to avoid a monthly service fee, knowing your fee period end date will help you keep track of when you need to meet one of the options available to avoid the fee.\n",
      "you’ll find the dates of your fee period in the monthly service fee summary on your account statement. the fee period end date is the last day posted transactions and account changes apply to that fee period. if your fee period ends on the last calendar day of the month, only transactions posted through the last business day of the month will count towards the fee period. pending transactions displayed in online banking are not posted transactions. deposits we make available early with early pay day are pending transactions until the deposit posts on the pay date scheduled by your payor.\n",
      "see “determining the day your deposit is received by the bank” in the “availability of funds policy” section in the deposit account agreement for more details on transaction posting. unless otherwise specified, maintenance or service requests for your account (for instance, setting up an automatic transfer or linking accounts) made after the cutoff time or on a non-business day will be processed and made effective on the next business day. combined balances are determined one business day prior to the last business day of your fee period.\n",
      "prime checking and premier checking accounts only: the fee period ends on the last business day of the calendar month. we use your statement-ending qualifying balance to determine your eligibility to avoid the monthly service fee. we calculate the monthly service fee, if any, on the last business day of the calendar month and post the fee on or about the first business day of the following month. monthly service fee summary is not available on the statement.\n",
      "initial monthly service fee waiver: we’ll waive the monthly service fee for each fee period ending within the first 64 days of opening.\n",
      "other fees subject to the fee period: we also use the fee period to count the number of posted transactions we allow before charging a fee. for example, if your account allows a certain number of no-charge atm transactions each fee period, we’ll only charge for atm transactions after that number has been met within the fee period. another example of such a fee is the check image option fee.\n",
      "your fee period can change: we may, at our discretion, change your fee period without prior notification. for example, when accounts are brought together into a combined statement, we change the fee period to match the fee period of the first account listed on the statement. when accounts are delinked from a combined statement, we may change the fee period for the delinked accounts.\n",
      "effect of early pay day: direct deposits made available early with early pay day will not count towards applicable options to avoid your account's monthly service fee until the deposit posts to your account and is no longer pending (e.g., the pay date scheduled by your payor). for more information about early pay day, please refer to our deposit account agreement.\n",

      "interest-bearing accounts\n",
      "for interest-bearing accounts, you may earn interest based on the account’s daily collected balance. the interest rate may be as low as 0.00%, and variable interest rates may be changed by the bank at any time. interest is compounded daily and paid monthly using a 365-day year. for more payment options for cds, see “interest on your cd” in the “time accounts (cds)” section of the deposit account agreement. for prime checking and premier checking, your relationship interest rate will end if you or the bank close your prime checking or premier checking account or de-link an eligible time account (cd) or savings account; for cds this change occurs at renewal. for more information, review “interest-bearing accounts” in the “statements, interest, and other account information” section of the deposit account agreement.\n",

      "Overview & Key Terms\n",
      "This document helps you understand your account features and requirements, the fees that may apply, and how to minimize or avoid fees where possible. If you don’t find your account type listed, check with a Wells Fargo banker for information about your account, including fees and other important information.\n",
      "What we mean by fee period and why it matters\n",
      "How we track and report your account activity, including what’s provided in your account statements, doesn’t always match a calendar month. Instead, we use a fee period to determine the monthly service fee and other monthly fees. A fee period can have 25 to 35 days. We calculate and post your monthly service fee, if any, on the last business day of your fee period. If your account allows you to avoid a monthly service fee, knowing your fee period end date will help you keep track of when you need to meet one of the options available to avoid the fee.\n",
      "You’ll find the dates of your fee period in the Monthly service fee summary on your account statement. The fee period end date is the last day posted transactions and account changes apply to that fee period. If your fee period ends on the last calendar day of the month, only transactions posted through the last business day of the month will count towards the fee period. Pending transactions displayed in online banking are not posted transactions. Deposits we make available early with Early Pay Day are pending transactions until the deposit posts on the pay date scheduled by your payor.\n",
      "See “Determining the day your deposit is received by the Bank” in the “Availability of Funds Policy” section in the Deposit Account Agreement for more details on transaction posting. Unless otherwise specified, maintenance or service requests for your account (for instance, setting up an automatic transfer or linking accounts) made after the cutoff time or on a non-business day will be processed and made effective on the next business day. Combined balances are determined one business day prior to the last business day of your fee period.\n",
      "Prime Checking and Premier Checking accounts only: The fee period ends on the last business day of the calendar month. We use your statement-ending qualifying balance to determine your eligibility to avoid the monthly service fee. We calculate the monthly service fee, if any, on the last business day of the calendar month and post the fee on or about the first business day of the following month. Monthly service fee summary is not available on the statement.\n",
      "Initial monthly service fee waiver: We’ll waive the monthly service fee for each fee period ending within the first 64 days of opening.\n",
      "Other fees subject to the fee period: We also use the fee period to count the number of posted transactions we allow before charging a fee. For example, if your account allows a certain number of no-charge ATM transactions each fee period, we’ll only charge for ATM transactions after that number has been met within the fee period. Another example of such a fee is the check image option fee.\n",
      "Your fee period can change: We may, at our discretion, change your fee period without prior notification. For example, when accounts are brought together into a combined statement, we change the fee period to match the fee period of the first account listed on the statement. When accounts are delinked from a combined statement, we may change the fee period for the delinked accounts.\n",
      "Effect of Early Pay Day: Direct deposits made available early with Early Pay Day will not count towards applicable options to avoid your account's monthly service fee until the deposit posts to your account and is no longer pending (e.g., the pay date scheduled by your payor). For more information about Early Pay Day, please refer to our Deposit Account Agreement.\n",

      "transactions have gone through nightly processing.\n",
      "Primary account owner When there is more than one owner of an account, we identify a primary owner. The primary account\n",
      "owner is the owner whose Taxpayer Identification Number, such as a Social Security Number, is assigned to the account and who, therefore, has tax responsibility for the account. For select checking and savings accounts, when an individual primary account owner reaches the age of 25, age can no longer be used to avoid the monthly service fee. Depending on the type of account you have, there may be other ways to avoid the monthly service fee. If the primary owner of an existing Everyday Checking, Clear Access BankingSM, or Way2Save® Savings account changes, it may take up to 45 days after the change is made to avoid the monthly service fee based on age.\n",

The interest rate may be as low as 0.00%, and variable interest rates may be changed by the Bank at any time. Interest is compounded daily and paid monthly using a 365-day year. For more payment options for CDs, see “Interest on your CD” in the “Time Accounts (CDs)” section of the Deposit Account Agreement. For Prime Checking and Premier Checking, your Relationship Interest Rate will end if you or the Bank close your Prime Checking or Premier Checking account or de-link an eligible time account (CD) or savings account; for CDs this change occurs at renewal.

For more information, review this Consumer Schedule and the \"Additional information for Wells Fargo Campus Card Program customers” section of the Deposit Account Agreement.\n",
      "Clear Access Banking\n",
      "Clear Access Banking is a checkless banking account. You cannot write checks against the account (including starter checks, temporary checks and personal checks ordered from a third party). Any checks written on this account will be returned unpaid, even if there’s enough money in the account to cover the payment. When a payee or merchant uses your account number and routing number to process a payment as a check, that transaction will be declined. It’s important that you notify the payee or merchant to make sure they don’t process your payment as a check. Otherwise, the payee or merchant may charge you a fee for a returned check.

With Clear Access Banking, if you don’t have available funds in your account to cover the transaction when it is presented to us for authorization or payment, we will: • Return certain transactions presented to us for payment (such as ACH payments) unpaid. • Not authorize ATM and everyday (one-time) debit card transactions into overdraft. • Not authorize other transactions (such as recurring debit card transactions or Bill Pay transactions)\n",
      "into overdraft.\n",
      "We won’t charge you a fee if we return or decline to authorize an item. However, payees or merchants may still charge a fee. Other optional overdraft services, such as Overdraft Protection and Debit Card Overdraft Service, are also unavailable on this account. References in the Deposit Account Agreement and in this document to standard overdraft coverage, Overdraft Protection, and Debit Card Overdraft Service, including associated overdraft fees, don’t apply to Clear Access Banking accounts.\n",
      "Negative balance Although we won’t authorize transactions—such as ATM withdrawals, debit card purchases, or recurring debit card transactions—when you don’t have enough money in your account to cover them when they are presented to us for authorization, certain transactions or account activity may result in a negative balance. For example, if you add a tip to a transaction after we’ve approved the transaction without the tip OR if we credit a deposit that is later returned unpaid, you may see a negative balance in your account. We won’t charge an overdraft fee for these transactions. You simply need to repay the negative amount promptly.\n",
      "Converting to Clear Access Banking from an account that has checks If you switch from a Wells Fargo account with check writing ability to a Clear Access Banking account, any outstanding check(s) presented on the new Clear Access Banking account on or after the date of conversion will be returned unpaid. The payee may charge additional fees when the check is returned. Make sure that any outstanding checks have been paid and/or you have made different arrangements with the payee(s) for the checks you have written before converting to the Clear Access Banking account.\n",
      "Converting to Clear Access Banking from an account that has overdraft services If you switch from a Wells Fargo account that included our standard overdraft coverage or was enrolled in our optional Debit Card Overdraft Service, those services will be removed from your account at the time of conversion. If your prior account was enrolled in our optional Overdraft Protection service, it will be removed from your account on the second business day after conversion (e.g., if you convert on Monday, it will be removed on Wednesday) and transactions occurring before removal may be paid into overdraft or returned unpaid, subject to the following exception: removal of Overdraft Protection from a linked savings account will be delayed by one business day for each day an Overdraft Protection transfer occurs after conversion.\n",
      "Any fees (for example, overdraft fees) resulting from account activity made or authorized prior to conversion may post to the account after conversion. In this event, any such fees will also be reflected in account activity summaries located within online banking and your account statement.\n",
      "Additional account limitations If you don’t qualify for our standard deposit accounts due to past credit or banking history and received the Funds Availability Adverse Action Notice as a part of your new account application process, you can still open or convert into a Clear Access Banking account. This will allow you to take advantage of Clear Access Banking features and benefits. For the first 365 days from the date your new account is opened (or from the date the account you’re converting from was opened, whichever is less), you won’t be able to convert into any other Wells Fargo account. After 365 days, you can convert into any Wells Fargo consumer checking account offered at that time.\n",
      "With the Worldwide Military Banking program, all non-Wells Fargo ATM cash withdrawal transaction fees will be waived worldwide for eligible checking accounts with a qualifying military direct deposit. Fees may still be charged by the non-Wells Fargo ATM operator or network. Prime Checking and Premier Checking accounts are not eligible for this program as they already receive a non-Wells Fargo ATM cash withdrawal fee waiver.\n",
      "To be eligible for the program, you must receive a qualifying military direct deposit of your salary, pension, or disability benefits electronically deposited from Department of Defense/Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DOD/DFAS), Department of Veterans Affairs/Veterans Benefits Administration (VA/ VBA), or U.S. Department of the Treasury from any branch of the United States military into an eligible checking account. An account will receive program benefits 45 days after the qualifying military direct deposit is deposited into the checking account. Your checking account will no longer receive benefits under this program if a qualifying military direct deposit is no longer deposited monthly into your qualifying checking account.\n",

The benefit applies to the exchange rate for foreign currency purchases, when you purchase foreign currency through the Wells Fargo Foreign Currency call center, online at wellsfargo.com, or through a Wells Fargo branch. You’ll also receive the benefit when you purchase or sell foreign currency at a Wells Fargo branch. In addition to any applicable fees, we make money when we convert one currency to another currency for you. The exchange rate used when we convert one currency to another is set at our sole discretion, and it includes a markup. The markup is designed to compensate us for several considerations including, without limitation, costs incurred, market risks, and our desired return. The applicable exchange rate does not include, and is separate from, any applicable fees listed in this Consumer Schedule. The exchange rate we provide to you may be different from exchange rates you see elsewhere. Different customers may receive different rates for transactions that are the same or similar, and the applicable exchange rate may be different for foreign currency cash, drafts, checks, or wire transfers. Foreign exchange markets are dynamic, and rates fluctuate over time based on market conditions, liquidity, and risks. We’re your arms-length counterparty on foreign exchange transactions.

      "text: 4. Outstanding Cashier’s checks and Money Orders are subject to state or territorial unclaimed property laws. 5. If the cashier’s check is lost, stolen, or destroyed , you may request a stop payment and reissuance. A stop payment and reissuance can only be completed within a branch location. As a condition of stop payment and reissuance, Wells Fargo Bank will require an indemnity agreement. In addition, for cashier’s checks over $1,000.00, the waiting period before the stop payment and reissuance of an outstanding cashier's check may be processed is 90 days (30 days in the state of Wisconsin and 91 days in the state of New York). The waiting period can be avoided with the purchase of an acceptable surety bond. This can be purchased through Wells Fargo’s approved insurance carrier or through an insurance carrier of the customer’s choice. The cost of a surety bond varies depending on the amount of the bond and the insurer used. Surety bonds are subject to the insurance carrier’s underwriting requirements before issuance. If the surety bond is not provided, the waiting period applies. 6. Fees may be charged by third parties or other banks, in addition to those described above. 7.

We regularly update this Consumer Schedule. You can get a copy of the current Consumer Schedule at wellsfargo.com , by requesting it from a banker, or by phone.\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n6\\n\\n6\\n\\n8\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\n10\\n\\n11\\n\\nOverview & Key Terms\\n\\nThis document helps you understand your account features and requirements, the fees that may apply, and how to minimize or avoid fees where possible. If you don\\u2019t find your account type listed, check with a Wells Fargo banker for information about your account, including fees and other important information.\\n\\nWhat we mean by fee period and why it matters\\n\\nHow we track and report your account activity, including what\\u2019s provided in your account statements, doesn\\u2019t always match a calendar month. Instead, we use a fee period to determine the monthly service fee and other monthly fees. A fee period can have 25 to 35 days. We calculate and post your monthly service fee, if any, on the last business day of your fee period. If your account allows you to avoid a monthly service fee, knowing your fee period end date will help you keep track of when you need to meet one of the options available to avoid the fee.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll find the dates of your fee period in the Monthly service fee summary on your account statement. The fee period end date is the last day posted transactions and account changes apply to that fee period. If your fee period ends on the last calendar day of the month, only transactions posted through the last business day of the month will count towards the fee period. Pending transactions displayed in online banking are not posted transactions. Deposits we make available early with Early Pay Day are pending transactions until the deposit posts on the pay date scheduled by your payor.\\n\\nSee \\u201cDetermining the day your deposit is received by the Bank\\u201d in the \\u201cAvailability of Funds Policy\\u201d section in the Deposit Account Agreement for more details on transaction posting. Unless otherwise specified, maintenance or service requests for your account (for instance, setting up an automatic transfer or linking accounts) made after the cutoff time or on a non-business day will be processed and made effective on the next business day. Combined balances are determined one business day prior to the last business day of your fee period.\\n\\nPrime Checking and Premier Checking accounts only: The fee period ends on the last business day of the calendar month. We use your statement-ending qualifying balance to determine your eligibility to avoid the monthly service fee. We calculate the monthly service fee, if any, on the last business day of the calendar month and post the fee on or about the first business day of the following month. Monthly service fee summary is not available on the statement.\\n\\nInitial monthly service fee waiver: We\\u2019ll waive the monthly service fee for each fee period ending within the first 64 days of opening.\\n\\nOther fees subject to the fee period: We also use the fee period to count the number of posted transactions we allow before charging a fee. For example, if your account allows a certain number of no-charge ATM transactions each fee period, we\\u2019ll only charge for ATM transactions after that number has been met within the fee period. Another example of such a fee is the check image option fee.\\n\\nYour fee period can change: We may, at our discretion, change your fee period without prior notification. For example, when accounts are brought together into a combined statement, we change the fee period to match the fee period of the first account listed on the statement. When accounts are delinked from a combined statement, we may change the fee period for the delinked accounts.\\n\\nEffect of Early Pay Day: Direct deposits made available early with Early Pay Day will not count towards applicable options to avoid your account's monthly service fee until the deposit posts to your account and is no longer pending (e.g., the pay date scheduled by your payor). For more information about Early Pay Day, please refer to our Deposit Account Agreement.\\n\\nMinimum daily balance Minimum daily balance refers to the lowest ending daily balance recorded during the fee period after all\\n\\ntransactions have gone through nightly processing.\\n\\nPrimary account owner When there is more than one owner of an account, we identify a primary owner. The primary account\\n\\nowner is the owner whose Taxpayer Identification Number, such as a Social Security Number, is assigned to the account and who, therefore, has tax responsibility for the account. For select checking and savings accounts, when an individual primary account owner reaches the age of 25, age can no longer be used to avoid the monthly service fee. Depending on the type of account you have, there may be other ways to avoid the monthly service fee. If the primary owner of an existing Everyday Checking, Clear Access BankingSM, or Way2Save\\u00ae Savings account changes, it may take up to 45 days after the change is made to avoid the monthly service fee based on age.\",\n",

We regularly update this Consumer Schedule. You can get a copy of the current Consumer Schedule at wellsfargo.com , by requesting it from a banker, or by phone.\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n6\\n\\n6\\n\\n8\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\n10\\n\\n11\\n\\nOverview & Key Terms\\n\\nThis document helps you understand your account features and requirements, the fees that may apply, and how to minimize or avoid fees where possible. If you don\\u2019t find your account type listed, check with a Wells Fargo banker for information about your account, including fees and other important information.\\n\\nWhat we mean by fee period and why it matters\\n\\nHow we track and report your account activity, including what\\u2019s provided in your account statements, doesn\\u2019t always match a calendar month. Instead, we use a fee period to determine the monthly service fee and other monthly fees. A fee period can have 25 to 35 days. We calculate and post your monthly service fee, if any, on the last business day of your fee period. If your account allows you to avoid a monthly service fee, knowing your fee period end date will help you keep track of when you need to meet one of the options available to avoid the fee.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll find the dates of your fee period in the Monthly service fee summary on your account statement. The fee period end date is the last day posted transactions and account changes apply to that fee period. If your fee period ends on the last calendar day of the month, only transactions posted through the last business day of the month will count towards the fee period. Pending transactions displayed in online banking are not posted transactions. Deposits we make available early with Early Pay Day are pending transactions until the deposit posts on the pay date scheduled by your payor.\\n\\nSee \\u201cDetermining the day your deposit is received by the Bank\\u201d in the \\u201cAvailability of Funds Policy\\u201d section in the Deposit Account Agreement for more details on transaction posting. Unless otherwise specified, maintenance or service requests for your account (for instance, setting up an automatic transfer or linking accounts) made after the cutoff time or on a non-business day will be processed and made effective on the next business day. Combined balances are determined one business day prior to the last business day of your fee period.\\n\\nPrime Checking and Premier Checking accounts only: The fee period ends on the last business day of the calendar month. We use your statement-ending qualifying balance to determine your eligibility to avoid the monthly service fee. We calculate the monthly service fee, if any, on the last business day of the calendar month and post the fee on or about the first business day of the following month. Monthly service fee summary is not available on the statement.\\n\\nInitial monthly service fee waiver: We\\u2019ll waive the monthly service fee for each fee period ending within the first 64 days of opening.\\n\\nOther fees subject to the fee period: We also use the fee period to count the number of posted transactions we allow before charging a fee. For example, if your account allows a certain number of no-charge ATM transactions each fee period, we\\u2019ll only charge for ATM transactions after that number has been met within the fee period. Another example of such a fee is the check image option fee.\\n\\nYour fee period can change: We may, at our discretion, change your fee period without prior notification. For example, when accounts are brought together into a combined statement, we change the fee period to match the fee period of the first account listed on the statement. When accounts are delinked from a combined statement, we may change the fee period for the delinked accounts.\\n\\nEffect of Early Pay Day: Direct deposits made available early with Early Pay Day will not count towards applicable options to avoid your account's monthly service fee until the deposit posts to your account and is no longer pending (e.g., the pay date scheduled by your payor). For more information about Early Pay Day, please refer to our Deposit Account Agreement.\\n\\nMinimum daily balance Minimum daily balance refers to the lowest ending daily balance recorded during the fee period after all\\n\\ntransactions have gone through nightly processing.\\n\\nPrimary account owner When there is more than one owner of an account, we identify a primary owner. The primary account\\n\\nowner is the owner whose Taxpayer Identification Number, such as a Social Security Number, is assigned to the account and who, therefore, has tax responsibility for the account. For select checking and savings accounts, when an individual primary account owner reaches the age of 25, age can no longer be used to avoid the monthly service fee. Depending on the type of account you have, there may be other ways to avoid the monthly service fee. If the primary owner of an existing Everyday Checking, Clear Access BankingSM, or Way2Save\\u00ae Savings account changes, it may take up to 45 days after the change is made to avoid the monthly service fee based on age.\",\n",

The interest rate may be as low as 0.00%, and variable interest rates may be changed by the Bank at any time. Interest is compounded daily and paid monthly using a 365-day year.

You cannot write checks against the account (including starter checks, temporary checks and personal checks ordered from a third party). Any checks written on this account will be returned unpaid, even if there\\u2019s enough money in the account to cover the payment. When a payee or merchant uses your account number and routing number to process a payment as a check, that transaction will be declined. It\\u2019s important that you notify the payee or merchant to make sure they don\\u2019t process your payment as a check. Otherwise, the payee or merchant may charge you a fee for a returned check. References in the Deposit Account Agreement to check-writing capabilities don\\u2019t apply to Clear Access Banking accounts.\\n\\n4\\n\\nWorldwide Military Banking program\\n\\nNo overdraft coverage Our standard overdraft coverage does not apply to Clear Access Banking accounts. You cannot request that standard overdraft coverage be added to your account. With Clear Access Banking, if you don\\u2019t have available funds in your account to cover the transaction when it is presented to us for authorization or payment, we will: \\u2022 Return certain transactions presented to us for payment (such as ACH payments) unpaid. \\u2022 Not authorize ATM and everyday (one-time) debit card transactions into overdraft. \\u2022 Not authorize other transactions (such as recurring debit card transactions or Bill Pay transactions)\",\n",

For example, if you add a tip to a transaction after we\\u2019ve approved the transaction without the tip OR if we credit a deposit that is later returned unpaid, you may see a negative balance in your account. We won\\u2019t charge an overdraft fee for these transactions. You simply need to repay the negative amount promptly.\\n\\nConverting to Clear Access Banking from an account that has checks If you switch from a Wells Fargo account with check writing ability to a Clear Access Banking account, any outstanding check(s) presented on the new Clear Access Banking account on or after the date of conversion will be returned unpaid.

In this event, any such fees will also be reflected in account activity summaries located within online banking and your account statement.\\n\\nAdditional account limitations If you don\\u2019t qualify for our standard deposit accounts due to past credit or banking history and received the Funds Availability Adverse Action Notice as a part of your new account application process, you can still open or convert into a Clear Access Banking account.

For the first 365 days from the date your new account is opened (or from the date the account you\\u2019re converting from was opened, whichever is less), you won\\u2019t be able to convert into any other Wells Fargo account.

The exchange rate used is set by Wells Fargo, includes a markup and may be different than exchange rates you see elsewhere.

When the amount of the fee charged by the non-Wells Fargo operator or network is not provided to Wells Fargo, Prime Checking and Premier Checking customers will receive a $4.00 reimbursement per cash withdrawal.\\n\\n2. For each debit card purchase in a foreign currency converted to a U.S. dollar amount by a network. 3. This benefit applies only to foreign currency cash. It does not apply to foreign currency drafts, checks, or wire transfers. The benefit applies to the exchange rate for foreign currency purchases, when you purchase foreign currency through the Wells Fargo Foreign Currency call center, online at wellsfargo.com, or through a Wells Fargo branch. You\\u2019ll also receive the benefit when you purchase or sell foreign currency at a Wells Fargo branch. In addition to any applicable fees, we make money when we convert one currency to another currency for you. The exchange rate used when we convert one currency to another is set at our sole discretion, and it includes a markup. The markup is designed to compensate us for several considerations including, without limitation, costs incurred, market risks, and our desired return. The applicable exchange rate does not include, and is separate from, any applicable fees listed in this Consumer Schedule. The exchange rate we provide to you may be different from exchange rates you see elsewhere. Different customers may receive different rates for transactions that are the same or similar, and the applicable exchange rate may be different for foreign currency cash, drafts, checks, or wire transfers. Foreign exchange markets are dynamic, and rates fluctuate over time based on market conditions, liquidity, and risks. We\\u2019re your arms-length counterparty on foreign exchange transactions. We may refuse to process any request for a foreign exchange transaction.\\n\\nYou may link your sole or jointly owned qualifying accounts to your Prime Checking or Premier Checking account to help you avoid the monthly service fee.

If the available balance in your savings account is less than either $25 or the amount needed, we\\u2019ll transfer the available balance.\\n\\nAdvances from linked eligible consumer credit account: If the available credit in your credit card account is $25 or more and can cover the overdraft, we\\u2019ll advance the exact amount needed or a minimum of $25.

You may also be charged fees for use of your debit card and ATM card by third parties such as stores and merchants, and by other banks and financial institutions for use of non-Wells Fargo ATMs. For your debit card, you may be charged by other banks and financial institutions for cash disbursements at their branches.\\n\\n2. Non-Wells Fargo ATMs are ATMs that are not owned or operated by Wells Fargo or are not prominently branded with the Wells Fargo name and logo. 3. U.S. includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia as well as the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, U.S. Minor Outlying Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands.\\n\\n4. Outstanding Cashier\\u2019s checks and Money Orders are subject to state or territorial unclaimed property laws. 5. If the cashier\\u2019s check is lost, stolen, or destroyed , you may request a stop payment and reissuance. A stop payment and reissuance can only be completed within a branch location. As a condition of stop payment and reissuance, Wells Fargo Bank will require an indemnity agreement. In addition, for cashier\\u2019s checks over $1,000.00, the waiting period before the stop payment and reissuance of an outstanding cashier's check may be processed is 90 days (30 days in the state of Wisconsin and 91 days in the state of New York). The waiting period can be avoided with the purchase of an acceptable surety bond. This can be purchased through Wells Fargo\\u2019s approved insurance carrier or through an insurance carrier of the customer\\u2019s choice. The cost of a surety bond varies depending on the amount of the bond and the insurer used. Surety bonds are subject to the insurance carrier\\u2019s underwriting requirements before issuance. If the surety bond is not provided, the waiting period applies. 6. Fees may be charged by third parties or other banks, in addition to those described above. 7. In addition to any applicable fees, we make money when we convert one currency to another currency for you. The exchange rate used when\\n\\nwe convert one currency to another is set at our sole discretion, and it includes a markup. The markup is designed to compensate us for several considerations including, without limitation, costs incurred, market risks, and our desired return. The applicable exchange rate does not include, and is separate from, any applicable fees. The exchange rate we provide to you may be different from exchange rates you see elsewhere. Different customers may receive different rates for transactions that are the same or similar, and the applicable exchange rate may be different for foreign currency cash, drafts, checks, or wire transfers. Foreign exchange markets are dynamic and rates fluctuate over time based on market conditions, liquidity, and risks. We're your arms-length counterparty on foreign exchange transactions. We may refuse to process any request for a foreign exchange transaction. 8. Incoming wire transfers received in a foreign currency for payment into your account will be converted into U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange\\n\\nrate without prior notice to you. For more information, see the \\u201cApplicable exchange rate\\u201d section of the Deposit Account Agreement.\\n\\nQuestions?

You may also be charged fees for use of your debit card and ATM card by third parties such as stores and merchants, and by other banks and financial institutions for use of non-Wells Fargo ATMs. For your debit card, you may be charged by other banks and financial institutions for cash disbursements at their branches.\\n\\n2. Non-Wells Fargo ATMs are ATMs that are not owned or operated by Wells Fargo or are not prominently branded with the Wells Fargo name and logo. 3. U.S. includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia as well as the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, U.S. Minor Outlying Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands.\\n\\n4. Outstanding Cashier\\u2019s checks and Money Orders are subject to state or territorial unclaimed property laws. 5. If the cashier\\u2019s check is lost, stolen, or destroyed , you may request a stop payment and reissuance. A stop payment and reissuance can only be completed within a branch location. As a condition of stop payment and reissuance, Wells Fargo Bank will require an indemnity agreement. In addition, for cashier\\u2019s checks over $1,000.00, the waiting period before the stop payment and reissuance of an outstanding cashier's check may be processed is 90 days (30 days in the state of Wisconsin and 91 days in the state of New York). The waiting period can be avoided with the purchase of an acceptable surety bond. This can be purchased through Wells Fargo\\u2019s approved insurance carrier or through an insurance carrier of the customer\\u2019s choice. The cost of a surety bond varies depending on the amount of the bond and the insurer used. Surety bonds are subject to the insurance carrier\\u2019s underwriting requirements before issuance. If the surety bond is not provided, the waiting period applies. 6. Fees may be charged by third parties or other banks, in addition to those described above. 7. In addition to any applicable fees, we make money when we convert one currency to another currency for you. The exchange rate used when\\n\\nwe convert one currency to another is set at our sole discretion, and it includes a markup. The markup is designed to compensate us for several considerations including, without limitation, costs incurred, market risks, and our desired return. The applicable exchange rate does not include, and is separate from, any applicable fees. The exchange rate we provide to you may be different from exchange rates you see elsewhere. Different customers may receive different rates for transactions that are the same or similar, and the applicable exchange rate may be different for foreign currency cash, drafts, checks, or wire transfers. Foreign exchange markets are dynamic and rates fluctuate over time based on market conditions, liquidity, and risks. We're your arms-length counterparty on foreign exchange transactions. We may refuse to process any request for a foreign exchange transaction. 8. Incoming wire transfers received in a foreign currency for payment into your account will be converted into U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange\\n\\nrate without prior notice to you.

We regularly update this Consumer Schedule. You can get a copy of the current Consumer Schedule at wellsfargo.com , by requesting it from a banker, or by phone.\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\n6\\n\\n6\\n\\n8\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\n10\\n\\n11\\n\\nOverview & Key Terms\\n\\nThis document helps you understand your account features and requirements, the fees that may apply, and how to minimize or avoid fees where possible. If you don\\u2019t find your account type listed, check with a Wells Fargo banker for information about your account, including fees and other important information.\\n\\nWhat we mean by fee period and why it matters\\n\\nHow we track and report your account activity, including what\\u2019s provided in your account statements, doesn\\u2019t always match a calendar month. Instead, we use a fee period to determine the monthly service fee and other monthly fees. A fee period can have 25 to 35 days. We calculate and post your monthly service fee, if any, on the last business day of your fee period. If your account allows you to avoid a monthly service fee, knowing your fee period end date will help you keep track of when you need to meet one of the options available to avoid the fee.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll find the dates of your fee period in the Monthly service fee summary on your account statement. The fee period end date is the last day posted transactions and account changes apply to that fee period. If your fee period ends on the last calendar day of the month, only transactions posted through the last business day of the month will count towards the fee period. Pending transactions displayed in online banking are not posted transactions. Deposits we make available early with Early Pay Day are pending transactions until the deposit posts on the pay date scheduled by your payor.\\n\\nSee \\u201cDetermining the day your deposit is received by the Bank\\u201d in the \\u201cAvailability of Funds Policy\\u201d section in the Deposit Account Agreement for more details on transaction posting. Unless otherwise specified, maintenance or service requests for your account (for instance, setting up an automatic transfer or linking accounts) made after the cutoff time or on a non-business day will be processed and made effective on the next business day. Combined balances are determined one business day prior to the last business day of your fee period.\\n\\nPrime Checking and Premier Checking accounts only: The fee period ends on the last business day of the calendar month. We use your statement-ending qualifying balance to determine your eligibility to avoid the monthly service fee. We calculate the monthly service fee, if any, on the last business day of the calendar month and post the fee on or about the first business day of the following month. Monthly service fee summary is not available on the statement.\\n\\nInitial monthly service fee waiver: We\\u2019ll waive the monthly service fee for each fee period ending within the first 64 days of opening.\\n\\nOther fees subject to the fee period: We also use the fee period to count the number of posted transactions we allow before charging a fee. For example, if your account allows a certain number of no-charge ATM transactions each fee period, we\\u2019ll only charge for ATM transactions after that number has been met within the fee period. Another example of such a fee is the check image option fee.\\n\\nYour fee period can change: We may, at our discretion, change your fee period without prior notification. For example, when accounts are brought together into a combined statement, we change the fee period to match the fee period of the first account listed on the statement. When accounts are delinked from a combined statement, we may change the fee period for the delinked accounts.\\n\\nEffect of Early Pay Day: Direct deposits made available early with Early Pay Day will not count towards applicable options to avoid your account's monthly service fee until the deposit posts to your account and is no longer pending (e.g., the pay date scheduled by your payor). For more information about Early Pay Day, please refer to our Deposit Account Agreement.\\n\\nMinimum daily balance Minimum daily balance refers to the lowest ending daily balance recorded during the fee period after all\\n\\ntransactions have gone through nightly processing.\\n\\nPrimary account owner When there is more than one owner of an account, we identify a primary owner. The primary account\\n\\nowner is the owner whose Taxpayer Identification Number, such as a Social Security Number, is assigned to the account and who, therefore, has tax responsibility for the account. For select checking and savings accounts, when an individual primary account owner reaches the age of 25, age can no longer be used to avoid the monthly service fee. Depending on the type of account you have, there may be other ways to avoid the monthly service fee. If the primary owner of an existing Everyday Checking, Clear Access BankingSM, or Way2Save\\u00ae Savings account changes, it may take up to 45 days after the change is made to avoid the monthly service fee based on age.\",\n",

The interest rate may be as low as 0.00%, and variable interest rates may be changed by the Bank at any time. Interest is compounded daily and paid monthly using a 365-day year. For more payment options for CDs, see \\u201cInterest on your CD\\u201d in the \\u201cTime Accounts (CDs)\\u201d section of the Deposit Account Agreement. For Prime Checking and Premier Checking, your Relationship Interest Rate will end if you or the Bank close your Prime Checking or Premier Checking account or de-link an eligible time account (CD) or savings account; for CDs this change occurs at renewal. For more information, review \\u201cInterest-bearing accounts\\u201d in the \\u201cStatements, Interest, and Other Account Information\\u201d section of the Deposit Account Agreement.\\n\\nRefer to the current consumer deposit interest rate sheet to find interest rates in your branch location.\\n\\n3\\n\\nEveryday Checking & Clear Access Banking\\n\\nAccount\\n\\nMonthly service fee\\n\\nHow to avoid the monthly period fee each service option (only one equir r\\n\\nfee\\n\\ned per account)\\n\\nMinimum opening deposit\\n\\nInterest- bearing\\n\\nOptional Overdraft Protection\\n\\nCheck - writing\\n\\nEveryday Checking\\n\\n$10\\n\\n$500 minimum daily balance \\u2022 $500 or more in total qualifying electronic deposits\\n\\nPrimary account owner is 17-24 years old \\u2022 Linked to a Wells Fargo Campus ATM Card or Campus Debit Card*\\n\\n$25\\n\\nNo\\n\\nYes\\n\\nYes\\n\\nClear Access Banking Minors 13-16 must have an adult co-owner.\\n\\n$5\\n\\nPrimary account owner is 13-24 years old\\n\\nLinked to a Wells Fargo Campus ATM Card or Campus Debit Card*\\n\\nLinked to a Wells Fargo Campus ATM Card or Campus Debit Card*\\n\\n$25\\n\\nNo\\n\\nNo\\n\\nQualifying electronic deposit for Everyday Checking\\n\\nA qualifying electronic deposit is a deposit of funds, such as your salary, government benefit payment, or other income, that has posted to your account and is (1) a direct deposit made through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, (2) an instant payment processed through the RTP\\u00ae network (real-time payment system) or FedNowSM Service, or (3) an electronic credit from a third party service that facilitates payments to your debit card using the Visa\\u00ae or Mastercard\\u00ae network (e.g. an Original Credit Transaction). Transfers from one account to another, mobile deposits, Zelle\\u00ae, or deposits made at a branch or ATM are not considered a qualifying electronic deposit.\\n\\nEveryday Checking and Clear Access Banking linked to Wells Fargo Campus Card\\n\\nEveryday Checking or Clear Access Banking accounts linked to an open, active Wells Fargo Campus CardSM from a participating college or university are eligible for the following additional fee benefits during each fee period. Ask a banker for more details about participating colleges and universities.\\n\\nNo Wells Fargo fees for up to 4 cash withdrawals from non-Wells Fargo ATMs in the U.S. (Fees charged by non-Wells Fargo ATM operators or networks may apply.) *\\n\\nNo fee charged for 1 overdraft (Standard overdraft coverage does not apply for Clear Access Banking) *\\n\\nCourtesy refund of 1 incoming domestic or international wire transfer fee * Whether or not the wire transfer fee is waived, Wells Fargo makes money when it converts one currency to another for you. The exchange rate used is set by Wells Fargo, includes a markup and may be different than exchange rates you see elsewhere. Incoming wire transfers received in a foreign currency for payment into your account will be converted into U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate without prior notice to you. For more information, see the \\u201cApplicable exchange rate\\u201d and \\u201cIncoming international wire transfers\\u201d sections of the Deposit Account Agreement.\\n\\nCampus Card fee benefits will take effect within 45 days following the linkage of your Campus Card to an Everyday Checking or Clear Access Banking account and will end 60 days after your Campus Card is no longer linked to the account. The Bank\\u2019s standard Everyday Checking or Clear Access Banking account terms and fees will apply when the Campus Card is no longer linked. For more information, review this Consumer Schedule and the \\\"Additional information for Wells Fargo Campus Card Program customers\\u201d section of the Deposit Account Agreement.\\n\\nClear Access Banking\\n\\nClear Access Banking is a checkless banking account. You cannot write checks against the account (including starter checks, temporary checks and personal checks ordered from a third party). Any checks written on this account will be returned unpaid, even if there\\u2019s enough money in the account to cover the payment. When a payee or merchant uses your account number and routing number to process a payment as a check, that transaction will be declined. It\\u2019s important that you notify the payee or merchant to make sure they don\\u2019t process your payment as a check. Otherwise, the payee or merchant may charge you a fee for a returned check. References in the Deposit Account Agreement to check-writing capabilities don\\u2019t apply to Clear Access Banking accounts.\\n\\n4\\n\\nWorldwide Military Banking program\\n\\nNo overdraft coverage Our standard overdraft coverage does not apply to Clear Access Banking accounts. You cannot request that standard overdraft coverage be added to your account. With Clear Access Banking, if you don\\u2019t have available funds in your account to cover the transaction when it is presented to us for authorization or payment, we will: \\u2022 Return certain transactions presented to us for payment (such as ACH payments) unpaid. \\u2022 Not authorize ATM and everyday (one-time) debit card transactions into overdraft. \\u2022 Not authorize other transactions (such as recurring debit card transactions or Bill Pay transactions)\\n\\ninto overdraft.\\n\\nWe won\\u2019t charge you a fee if we return or decline to authorize an item. However, payees or merchants may still charge a fee. Other optional overdraft services, such as Overdraft Protection and Debit Card Overdraft Service, are also unavailable on this account. References in the Deposit Account Agreement and in this document to standard overdraft coverage, Overdraft Protection, and Debit Card Overdraft Service, including associated overdraft fees, don\\u2019t apply to Clear Access Banking accounts.\\n\\nNegative balance Although we won\\u2019t authorize transactions\\u2014such as ATM withdrawals, debit card purchases, or recurring debit card transactions\\u2014when you don\\u2019t have enough money in your account to cover them when they are presented to us for authorization, certain transactions or account activity may result in a negative balance. For example, if you add a tip to a transaction after we\\u2019ve approved the transaction without the tip OR if we credit a deposit that is later returned unpaid, you may see a negative balance in your account. We won\\u2019t charge an overdraft fee for these transactions. You simply need to repay the negative amount promptly.\\n\\nConverting to Clear Access Banking from an account that has checks If you switch from a Wells Fargo account with check writing ability to a Clear Access Banking account, any outstanding check(s) presented on the new Clear Access Banking account on or after the date of conversion will be returned unpaid. The payee may charge additional fees when the check is returned. Make sure that any outstanding checks have been paid and/or you have made different arrangements with the payee(s) for the checks you have written before converting to the Clear Access Banking account.\",\n",

If your prior account was enrolled in our optional Overdraft Protection service, it will be removed from your account on the second business day after conversion (e.g., if you convert on Monday, it will be removed on Wednesday) and transactions occurring before removal may be paid into overdraft or returned unpaid, subject to the following exception: removal of Overdraft Protection from a linked savings account will be delayed by one business day for each day an Overdraft Protection transfer occurs after conversion.\\n\\nAny fees (for example, overdraft fees) resulting from account activity made or authorized prior to conversion may post to the account after conversion. In this event, any such fees will also be reflected in account activity summaries located within online banking and your account statement.\\n\\nAdditional account limitations If you don\\u2019t qualify for our standard deposit accounts due to past credit or banking history and received the Funds Availability Adverse Action Notice as a part of your new account application process, you can still open or convert into a Clear Access Banking account. This will allow you to take advantage of Clear Access Banking features and benefits. For the first 365 days from the date your new account is opened (or from the date the account you\\u2019re converting from was opened, whichever is less), you won\\u2019t be able to convert into any other Wells Fargo account. After 365 days, you can convert into any Wells Fargo consumer checking account offered at that time.\\n\\nWith the Worldwide Military Banking program, all non-Wells Fargo ATM cash withdrawal transaction fees will be waived worldwide for eligible checking accounts with a qualifying military direct deposit. Fees may still be charged by the non-Wells Fargo ATM operator or network. Prime Checking and Premier Checking accounts are not eligible for this program as they already receive a non-Wells Fargo ATM cash withdrawal fee waiver.\\n\\nTo be eligible for the program, you must receive a qualifying military direct deposit of your salary, pension, or disability benefits electronically deposited from Department of Defense/Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DOD/DFAS), Department of Veterans Affairs/Veterans Benefits Administration (VA/ VBA), or U.S. Department of the Treasury from any branch of the United States military into an eligible checking account. An account will receive program benefits 45 days after the qualifying military direct deposit is deposited into the checking account. Your checking account will no longer receive benefits under this program if a qualifying military direct deposit is no longer deposited monthly into your qualifying checking account.\\n\\n5\\n\\nPrime Checking & Premier Checking\\n\\nAccount\\n\\nMonthly service fee\\n\\nHow to avoid the monthly service fee each fee period\\n\\nMinimum opening deposit\\n\\nInterest- bearing\\n\\nOptional Overdraft Protection\\n\\nCheck - writing\\n\\nPrime Checking\\n\\n$25\\n\\n$20,000 or more in statement-ending qualifying linked (a) consumer bank deposit account balances (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC-insured IRAs) and (b) investment account balances (brokerage available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors, 1 ,2 applicable bank fiduciary and custody accounts, annuities, 3 ,4 and eligible foreign exchange transactions)\\n\\n$25\\n\\nYes; interest rates are variable\\n\\nYes\\n\\nYes\\n\\nPremier Checking\\n\\n$35\\n\\n$250,000 or more in statement-ending qualifying linked (a) consumer bank deposit account balances (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC-insured IRAs) and (b) investment account balances (brokerage available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors, 1 ,2 applicable bank fiduciary and custody accounts, annuities, 3 ,4 and eligible foreign exchange transactions)\\n\\n$25\\n\\nYes; interest rates are variable\\n\\nYes\\n\\nYes\\n\\nInvestment and Insurance Products are: \\u2022 Not Insured by the FDIC or Any Federal Government Agency \\u2022 Not a Deposit or Other Obligation of, or Guaranteed by, the Bank or Any Bank Affiliate \\u2022 Subject to Investment Risks, Including Possible Loss of the Principal Amount Invested\\n\\n1.

The exchange rate used is set by Wells Fargo, includes a markup and may be different than exchange rates you see elsewhere. Incoming wire transfers received in a foreign currency for payment into your account will be converted into U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate without prior notice to you. For more information, see the \\u201cApplicable exchange rate\\u201d and \\u201cIncoming international wire transfers\\u201d sections of the Deposit Account Agreement. ** The Relationship Interest Rate is variable and subject to change at any time without notice, including setting the interest rate equal to the Standard Interest Rate or to zero (0.00%), which could change the Relationship Annual Percentage Yield (APY). For time accounts, the change will occur upon renewal. To receive the disclosed Relationship Interest Rate/Relationship APY, the eligible account must remain linked to a Prime Checking or Premier Checking account. Time accounts must be linked at account open and at every renewal. If the checking account is closed for any reason or the eligible savings account or time account is de-linked, the account will revert to the then-current applicable Standard Interest Rate on that date; for time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. Any Special Interest Rate would not expire until the expiration date of that Special Interest Rate.\\n\\n6\\n\\nMore about linked accounts\\n\\nStatements\\n\\nPrime Checking\\n\\nPremier Checking\\n\\nReimbursed fees charged by non-Wells Fargo ATMs 1\\n\\n1 U.S. and 1 international per fee period\\n\\nunlimited\\n\\nWaiver of international purchase transaction fee with your Wells Fargo Debit Card 2\",\n",

When the amount of the fee charged by the non-Wells Fargo operator or network is not provided to Wells Fargo, Prime Checking and Premier Checking customers will receive a $4.00 reimbursement per cash withdrawal.\\n\\n2. For each debit card purchase in a foreign currency converted to a U.S. dollar amount by a network. 3. This benefit applies only to foreign currency cash. It does not apply to foreign currency drafts, checks, or wire transfers. The benefit applies to the exchange rate for foreign currency purchases, when you purchase foreign currency through the Wells Fargo Foreign Currency call center, online at wellsfargo.com, or through a Wells Fargo branch. You\\u2019ll also receive the benefit when you purchase or sell foreign currency at a Wells Fargo branch. In addition to any applicable fees, we make money when we convert one currency to another currency for you. The exchange rate used when we convert one currency to another is set at our sole discretion, and it includes a markup. The markup is designed to compensate us for several considerations including, without limitation, costs incurred, market risks, and our desired return. The applicable exchange rate does not include, and is separate from, any applicable fees listed in this Consumer Schedule. The exchange rate we provide to you may be different from exchange rates you see elsewhere. Different customers may receive different rates for transactions that are the same or similar, and the applicable exchange rate may be different for foreign currency cash, drafts, checks, or wire transfers. Foreign exchange markets are dynamic, and rates fluctuate over time based on market conditions, liquidity, and risks. We\\u2019re your arms-length counterparty on foreign exchange transactions. We may refuse to process any request for a foreign exchange transaction.\\n\\nYou may link your sole or jointly owned qualifying accounts to your Prime Checking or Premier Checking account to help you avoid the monthly service fee. A qualifying account may be linked to only one Prime Checking or Premier Checking account.\\n\\nIf you or we delink an account from your Prime Checking or Premier Checking account, then effective immediately, benefits no longer apply to that delinked account. You\\u2019ll no longer receive discounts, options to avoid fees, or the Relationship Interest Rate on the delinked account. For a delinked time account (CD), this change will occur at renewal. Your delinked account will revert to the Bank\\u2019s current applicable interest rate or fee at that time. Benefits available to your Prime Checking or Premier Checking account and any remaining linked accounts will continue.\\n\\nYou may link or delink your qualifying accounts through online banking, by speaking with a banker, or by calling the number at the top of your statement. In addition, unless you specify otherwise, eligible accounts with the same ownership as the Prime Checking or Premier Checking account will be automatically linked weekly.\\n\\nYour account information may be made available to any other owner on any of the linked accounts. If the Prime Checking or Premier Checking account to which your other accounts are linked closes for any reason, then all remaining eligible accounts will also be delinked. If we determine your accounts are no longer eligible for linking, we may delink them and we\\u2019re not required to notify you if we do.\\n\\nWe make available to you your Prime Checking or Premier Checking statement on or about the seventh business day of the following month and provide either Detail Level (if eligible) or Summary Level information on your linked accounts in your statement. If you request that we link your qualifying accounts on the last business day of the month, then we\\u2019ll include that account information on the following month\\u2019s statement.\\n\\nIf you elect Summary Level information for an account linked to your Prime Checking or Premier Checking account, then you\\u2019ll continue to receive your separate regular Detail Level statement for that account.\\n\\n7\\n\\nStatements for linked accounts: The Prime Checking or Premier Checking account must always be linked in Detail. Additional checking and savings accounts can be linked in either Detail or Summary, depending on ownership. All non-FDIC insured accounts can only be linked in Summary. For other linked accounts, you\\u2019ll have a choice of receiving Detail or Summary Level Information. We may change your statement option from linked in Detail Level to Summary Level at our discretion.\\n\\nIf accounts are linked in Detail Level format, all information regarding the linked account will be included in the combined statement in detail. A standalone account statement will be created for the linked checking and savings account and be available online only.\\n\\nIf accounts are linked in Summary Level format, account information will be included in the combined statement in summary and a standalone account statement will be created for the linked account. The standalone account statement will be delivered based on the account delivery preference. For linked accounts where at least one of the owner(s) of the linked account isn\\u2019t the same as at least one of the owner(s) of the Prime Checking or Premier Checking account, the linked account can only be linked at a Summary Level.\\n\\nThe owners of the Prime Checking or Premier Checking account, as well as any additional owners of each linked account, are responsible for verifying the accuracy of account information for the linked account.\\n\\nClosing a Prime Checking or Premier Checking account or delinking accounts\\n\\nIf your Prime Checking or Premier Checking account is converted to another checking product or closed by us or you, all linked accounts are delinked from the Prime Checking or Premier Checking account and effective immediately, benefits no longer apply, including benefits to your now delinked accounts. You\\u2019ll no longer receive discounts, options to avoid fees on other products or services, or the Relationship Interest Rate; for time accounts (CDs), this change will occur at renewal.

If the available balance in your savings account is less than either $25 or the amount needed, we\\u2019ll transfer the available balance.\\n\\nAdvances from linked eligible consumer credit account: If the available credit in your credit card account is $25 or more and can cover the overdraft, we\\u2019ll advance the exact amount needed or a minimum of $25. If the available credit in your credit card account is less than either $25 or the amount needed, we\\u2019ll advance the available credit.

You may also be charged fees for use of your debit card and ATM card by third parties such as stores and merchants, and by other banks and financial institutions for use of non-Wells Fargo ATMs. For your debit card, you may be charged by other banks and financial institutions for cash disbursements at their branches.\\n\\n2. Non-Wells Fargo ATMs are ATMs that are not owned or operated by Wells Fargo or are not prominently branded with the Wells Fargo name and logo. 3. U.S. includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia as well as the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, U.S. Minor Outlying Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands.\\n\\n4. Outstanding Cashier\\u2019s checks and Money Orders are subject to state or territorial unclaimed property laws. 5. If the cashier\\u2019s check is lost, stolen, or destroyed , you may request a stop payment and reissuance. A stop payment and reissuance can only be completed within a branch location. As a condition of stop payment and reissuance, Wells Fargo Bank will require an indemnity agreement. In addition, for cashier\\u2019s checks over $1,000.00, the waiting period before the stop payment and reissuance of an outstanding cashier's check may be processed is 90 days (30 days in the state of Wisconsin and 91 days in the state of New York). The waiting period can be avoided with the purchase of an acceptable surety bond. This can be purchased through Wells Fargo\\u2019s approved insurance carrier or through an insurance carrier of the customer\\u2019s choice. The cost of a surety bond varies depending on the amount of the bond and the insurer used. Surety bonds are subject to the insurance carrier\\u2019s underwriting requirements before issuance. If the surety bond is not provided, the waiting period applies. 6. Fees may be charged by third parties or other banks, in addition to those described above. 7. In addition to any applicable fees, we make money when we convert one currency to another currency for you. The exchange rate used when\\n\\nwe convert one currency to another is set at our sole discretion, and it includes a markup. The markup is designed to compensate us for several considerations including, without limitation, costs incurred, market risks, and our desired return. The applicable exchange rate does not include, and is separate from, any applicable fees. The exchange rate we provide to you may be different from exchange rates you see elsewhere. Different customers may receive different rates for transactions that are the same or similar, and the applicable exchange rate may be different for foreign currency cash, drafts, checks, or wire transfers. Foreign exchange markets are dynamic and rates fluctuate over time based on market conditions, liquidity, and risks. We're your arms-length counterparty on foreign exchange transactions. We may refuse to process any request for a foreign exchange transaction. 8. Incoming wire transfers received in a foreign currency for payment into your account will be converted into U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange\\n\\nrate without prior notice to you. For more information, see the \\u201cApplicable exchange rate\\u201d section of the Deposit Account Agreement.\\n\\nQuestions?
